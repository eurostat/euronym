# Euronym

Place name labels for multi-scale web mapping applications, with a focus on Europe.

Euronym labels are produced using a [label placement algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_label_placement) to adapt the density, selection and size of labels depending on the zoom level and label importance.

## Examples

Euronym is used with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library. See [this example](https://observablehq.com/d/b1fbb3b3e3255645).

Euronym is used with [Gridviz](https://github.com/eurostat/gridviz/blob/master/docs/reference.md#labellayer) library. See [this example](https://eurostat.github.io/gridviz/examples/basics/labels_.html).

## API

Base URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euronym/Nuts2json/master/pub/v2`
(See [here](#own-deployment) how to define your own base URL)

URL pattern:  `/<ENCODING>/<RESOLUTION>/<GEO>.csv`

For example, [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/euronym/main/pub/v2/UTF/100/LU.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/euronym/main/pub/v2/UTF/100/LU.csv) returns UTF data for resolution 100m/pixel over Luxembourg.

The parameters are:

| Parameter | Supported values | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| `ENCODING` | `UTF_LATIN` `UTF` `ASCII` | The encoding. By default, you should use `UTF_LATIN`. |
| `RESOLUTION` | `20` `50` `100` `200` | The most detailled resolution. The unit is the zoom level of your visualisation expressed in *m/pixel*. If small, more labels are necessary and the file gets larger. |
| `GEO` | See for example [here](https://github.com/eurostat/euronym/tree/main/pub/v2/UTF/20). `EUR` is for the entire dataset. | The code of the geographic entity to cover. |

For additional parameters, feel free to [ask](https://github.com/eurostat/euronym/issues/new) !

## Format

A CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `name` | The place name text, to be written on the map. |
| `lon` | The longitude.  |
| `lat` | The latitude. |
| `rs` | Above this resolution, the label should not be shown. |
| `r1` | Above this resolution, the label may be exagerated. |
| `cc` | The country code. This is provided when `GEO` is set to `EUR`. This allows doing some filtering based on country. |

The resolutions are expressed in *m/pixel*: This is the size of a screen pixel in ground meter. The smaller, the more detail.

*rs* and *r1* values are computed so that:
- For resolutions above *rs*, the label should not be shown,
- For resolutions within [*rs*, *r1*], the label should be shown with a *1em* size,
- For resolutions above *r1*, the label should be shown with a *1.5em* size (that is exagerated).

Longitude and latitude are expressed in ETRS89 ([EPSG 4258](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89/)), which can be considered as identical to WGS84.

## Input data

Euronym relies on the following datasets:

- [EuroRegionalMap](https://eurogeographics.org/maps-for-europe/euroregionalmap/), by [EuroGeographics](https://eurogeographics.org/) (class *BuiltupP*).
- [European commission town names table](https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/information-sources/maps/urban-centres-towns_en)

The transformation process is available [here](https://github.com/eurostat/euronym/tree/main/src/), based on [GeoTools library](https://www.geotools.org).

## Own deployment

To deploy your own stable version of Euronym, `git clone` the repository and simply publish the `pub` folder on your own web server folder accessible under the URL of your choice. Use the new base URL, for example `https://www.mydomain.eu/path/to/pub/v2`, to access the service. This offers the possibility to select only the necessary API elements of interest.
